This repository is an answer to the code assessment https://github.com/peck/engineering-assessment

This requires a Phoenix version new enough to support `.heex` files.

Tested with

- Elixir 1.14.2
- Phoenix 1.6.15

To start your Phoenix server:

- Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000/htc`](http://localhost:4000/htc) from your browser. Please do not visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) as that just leads to a "Welcome to Phoenix" default page given by `mix phx.new`.
